# Project Euler Problem 2: Even Fibonacci Number
'''Synopsis: Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. 
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.'''

#Create list of Fibonacci numbers whose values do not exceed 4,000,000 
Fiblist=[1,2]
while Fiblist:
    listlen=len(Fiblist)
    num=Fiblist[listlen-1]+Fiblist[listlen-2]
    if num<4000000:
        Fiblist.append(num)
        continue
    else:
        break


#Create new list of Fibonacci numbers that consist of even numbers
evenFiblist=[]
for num in Fiblist:
    if num%2==0:
        evenFiblist.append(num)
    else:
        continue


#sum of even valued terms
Fibsum=sum(evenFiblist)
